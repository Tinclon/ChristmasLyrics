Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Of the Lord and Savior
We the tidings tell

(Chorus)
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Angels from on high
Say shepherds come and see
He is born in Bethlehem
A blessed Man for thee

Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Shepherds in a child light
In a manger stall

Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Magi oriental journey from afar
When they come to meet Him
Meet the shining star

Glory to God
For Christ the King is born
Glory to God
For Christ the King is born

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
