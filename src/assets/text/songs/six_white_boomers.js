Early on one Christmas Day, a joey kangaroo 
Was far from home and lost in a great big zoo 
"Mummy, where's my mummy? They've taken her away" 
"We'll help you find your mummy son, hop on the sleigh".

Up beside the bag of toys, little Joey hopped 
But they hadn't gone far when Santa stopped 
Unharnessed all the reindeer and Joey wondered why 
Then he heard a far off booming in the sky. 
Chorus: 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
On his Australian run.

Pretty soon old Santa began to feel the heat 
Took his fur-lined boots off to cool his feet. 
Into one popped Joey, feeling quite OK 
While those old man kangaroos kept pulling on the sleigh.

Chorus: 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
On his Australian run.

Joey said to Santa, "Santa, what about the toys 
Aren't you giving some to these girls and boys?" 
"They've all got their presents son, we were here last night 
This trip is an extra trip, Joey's special flight."

Chorus: 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
On his Australian run.

Soon the sleigh was flashing past, right over Marble Bar 
"Slow down there," cried Santa, "It can't be far. 
Come up on my lap son, and have a look around." 
"There she is, that's mummy, bounding up and down."

Chorus: 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
On his Australian run.

Well that's the bestest Christmas treat that Joey ever had 
Curled up in mother's pouch all snug and glad. 
The last they saw was Santa headed northward from the sun 
The only year the boomers worked a double run.

Chorus: 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun 
Six white boomers, snow white boomers 
On his Australian run.
