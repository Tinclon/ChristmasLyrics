A ray of hope flitters in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds have changed whisperin' the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy fume settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) And all of this happens
Because the world is waiting
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Hate to love, war to peace
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) And everyone to everyone's neighbour
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever

It's all a dream and illusion now
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
