What Child is this who, laid to rest\nOn Mary's lap is sleeping?\nWhom Angels greet with anthems sweet,\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping?\n\nThis, this is Christ the King,\nWhom shepherds guard and Angels sing;\nHaste, haste, to bring Him laud,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n\n2. Why lies He in such mean estate,\nWhere ox and ass are feeding?\nGood Christians, fear, for sinners here\nThe silent Word is pleading.\n\nNails, spear shall pierce Him through,\nThe cross be borne for me, for you.\nHail, hail the Word made flesh,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n\n3. So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,\nCome peasant, king to own Him;\nThe King of kings salvation brings,\nLet loving hearts enthrone Him.\n\nRaise, raise a song on high,\nThe virgin sings her lullaby.\nJoy, joy for Christ is born,\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n`","export default () => `\nWhen A Child Is Born\n\nMmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm\nMmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm\nMmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm\nMmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm\n\nA ray of hope flitters in the sky\nA tiny star lights up way up high\nAll across the land dawns a brand new morn\nThis comes to pass when a child is born\n\nA silent wish sails the seven seas\nThe winds have changed whisperin' the trees\nAnd the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn\nThis comes to pass when a child is born\n\nA rosy fume settles all around\nYou've got the feel you're on solid ground\nFor a spell or two no one seems forlorn\nThis comes to pass when a child is born\n\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) And all of this happens\nBecause the world is waiting\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) Waiting for one child\nBlack, white, yellow, no one knows\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Hate to love, war to peace\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) And everyone to everyone's neighbour\nMisery and suffering would be forgotten forever\n\nIt's all a dream and illusion now\nIt must come true, sometimes soon somehow\nAll across the land dawns a brand new morn\nThis comes to pass when a child is born\n`","export default () => `\nWhite Christmas\n\nI'm dreaming of a White Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know\nWhere the treetops glisten\nand children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow.\n\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white.\n\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nMay your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white.\n`","export default () => `\nWith Wondering Awe\n\n1.
