O Holy Night

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviourâ€™s birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand;
So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wide men from the Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials born to be our friend;

He knows our need,
to our weakness no stranger
Behold your King!
before the lowly bend!
Behold your King!
your King! before Him bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains He shall break, for the slave is our brother,
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy Name

Christ is the Lord
Then ever ever praise we
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim
