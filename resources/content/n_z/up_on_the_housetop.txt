Up on the Housetop

Up on the housetop
Reindeer pause,
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney
With lots of toys
All for the little ones,
Christmas joys

Chorus:
Ho, ho, ho!
Who wouldn’t go
Ho, ho, ho!
Who wouldn’t go
Up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney
With good Saint Nick

First comes the stocking 
Of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa fill it well
Give her a dolly that
Laughs and cries
One that will open and
Shut her eyes

Repeat chorus

Next comes the
Stocking of little Will
Oh just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
Also a ball and a whip that cracks
